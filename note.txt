1. next step i want to do is to make a list of the similar vendor name in the inventory list 
2. apply a filter to the table 
3. if i get to see that same vendor have same item but different unit price the user can merge the things and add a new price to it 
as the use do this the inventory gets updated on its own 
is it a good idea !!
